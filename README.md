Laser–LDR Based Intrusion Detection System using Arduino UNO

This project implements a laser-based intrusion detection system using an Arduino UNO, laser module, LDR (Light Dependent Resistor), and a buzzer.

A laser beam is continuously aligned with the LDR. Under normal conditions, the LDR receives constant light from the laser. When any object or person passes through the laser path, the beam is interrupted, causing a sudden change in light intensity. The Arduino detects this variation and immediately triggers a buzzer to indicate an intrusion.

This system can be used for security and protection applications, such as:
~ Museums and art galleries
~ Restricted or high-security areas
~ Protection of valuable objects
~ Entry monitoring and alert systems

The project is simple, cost-effective, and demonstrates the practical use of optical sensors, Arduino programming, and real-time alert mechanisms.

Features:
~ Real-time intrusion detection
~ Quick response using laser–LDR sensing
~ Easy to implement and scalable
~ Suitable for beginners and security-based projects

Components Used:
1. Arduino UNO
2. Laser module
3. LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)
4. Buzzer
5. Resistors and jumper wires


The complete Arduino code and working logic are provided in this repository.
